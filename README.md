# SpaceFillingCurveAudioPlayer
This will eventually use a space filling curve to map image pixel data to audio stream and output it.

This is a work in (*slow*) progress. Right know all I can do is display the image highlite a location on the image (using a simple forward lighting effect) calculate a Hemolton Curve move my highlighting effect move along this cureve and render some realtime audio. 

# Installation
This uses Qt and Qt only. It shoud run fine in Qt creator.
